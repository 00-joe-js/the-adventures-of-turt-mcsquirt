Help Turt find the alfalfa! You can move Turt with arrow keys, but you can also call `window.moveTurt` from your Dev Tools console with "up", "down", "left", or "right" as an argument.

Can you develop a recursive function that moves Turt to their goal? Tips:

1) When you call `window.moveTurt` (example: `window.moveTurt("up")`), you will get a `true` if you can move in that direction, or `undefined` if you cannot move in that direction.
2) You will see a win screen when you Turt reaches their goal, which you can test by moving Turt manually to the alfalfa with arrow keys. `window.moveTurt` will not return anything different when you've won.
